a question: i can't figure out why i can't get the database to actually clear after every test. It is not clearing between my GET all and GET?:id tests, no matter what i seem to try :(
and observation: async testing is really really hard, apparently.
your original estimate: 5 hours (mostly due to overactive bladder and a 30 minute round trip to the restroom at the armory, while the restrooms were being fixed)
how long you spent: ~5 hours
